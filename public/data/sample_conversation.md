## Conversation

### Staff Member (1)

hi my name is Russell and I'm going to be taking care of you today is this your first time at Milea estate

### Guest (2)

*smiling* Hi Russell, it's great to meet you! Yes, this is our first time visiting Milea Estate. My name is Sarah and this is my husband Michael. We live nearby in Pleasant Valley and have been meaning to come check out the winery for a while now. We're excited to learn more about your wines and the story behind the winery.

### Staff Member (3)

Nice to meet you Sarah and Michael. Very cool, Pleasant Valley has a lot of history. Let me tell you about our tasting options today. Since it's your first time here, I recommend trying our signature flight which includes 5 of our most popular wines. It's a great introduction to what we do here. You can see all the details on the menu there. Would you like to start with that?

### Guest (4)

That sounds perfect! We'd love to try the signature flight. We're both particularly interested in reds, but we enjoy trying everything. Do you have any personal favorites in the lineup?

### Staff Member (5)

If you like reds, you'll really enjoy our Vincenza, which is our estate cabernet franc. It won a silver medal last year. It's named after Barry Milea's mother, so it has a special place in our hearts. It has nice notes of cherries, graphite. Let me pour your first taste, which is our white blend.

### Guest (6)

Thank you! *takes a sip* Wow, this is lovely - very crisp and refreshing. So what made the Milea family decide to start a winery in this region?

### Staff Member (7)

You can read a bit about our history on the back of the menu, but basically the property has been in the family for a while and they decided to plant vineyards about 10 years ago. Let me pour you the next taste, this is our estate Chardonnay.

### Guest (8)

*tastes the Chardonnay* This has a wonderful balance - not too oaky. I really like this one! *turns to partner* What do you think, Michael? This might be nice to have with that seafood pasta you make.

### Staff Member (9)

Yeah, it would go great with seafood pasta. Now here's our rosé, which is made from cabernet franc grapes.

### Guest (10)

*tastes the rosé* Oh, this is delightful! So refreshing with nice fruit notes. I can imagine enjoying this on our patio this summer. Do you sell many bottles of this one?

### Staff Member (11)

Yeah, it's popular especially in summer. Now let me pour you the Vincenza I mentioned, our estate cabernet franc.

### Guest (12)

*tastes cabernet franc* Oh wow, this is exceptional! I love the complexity and the finish. Michael, we definitely need to take a couple bottles of this home. If this wine regularly sells out, maybe we should consider joining your wine club?

### Staff Member (13)

This is definitely one of our most popular wines. Let me pour you our last taste, which is our red blend called Proprietor's Reserve.

### Guest (14)

*tastes the red blend* This is fantastic too! You really have some outstanding reds. Do you offer any food here? We'd love to stay a bit longer and perhaps have a small plate with another glass of that wonderful Cabernet Franc.

### Staff Member (15)

Yes, we have a small food menu. I recommend the brussels sprouts or the arancini, they're both really popular.

### Guest (16)

Perfect! We'll take an order of both and two glasses of the Cabernet Franc, please. By the way, how many acres of vineyards do you have here?

### Staff Member (17)

We have about 98 acres total on the property, but not all of it is planted yet. Let me get those food items and glasses for you.

### Guest (18)

*after enjoying the food and additional wine* This has been such a lovely experience, Russell. The wines are exceptional and the view is stunning. We'll definitely want to take home some bottles today.

### Staff Member (19)

Great, when I come back I will have your check be ready to check out.

### Guest (20)

Thank you! We'd like three bottles of the Cabernet Franc and two of the Chardonnay, please. Maybe we should join the wine club so we can secure an allocation of that Cab Franc in the future!
