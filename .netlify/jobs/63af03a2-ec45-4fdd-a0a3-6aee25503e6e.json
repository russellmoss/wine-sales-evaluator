Yes, this is our first time visiting Milea Estate. My wife Sarah and I have heard wonderful things about your wines and we're excited to learn more. The property looks beautiful!\n\n### Staff Member (3)\n\nwell cool  so  here's our menus  on the first page you'll find a little bit more about the history of Malaya estate and then the next page you'll actually find a giveaway that we're doing which is really cool  so the grand prize is a private dinner for two  catered by our  executive chef David Kim  but there's a 100% chance of winning the other prizes are discounts on wines and free tastings so if you scan that QR code you can just easily enter  then on the next page you'll find our  curated tasting flights  so since this is your first time I would definitely suggest doing a flight to really get a sense for what Malia does these lights include four wines that are pre-selected  to really showcase Malaya  these include our  Cabernet Franc which is a  a flagship red grape as well as the group cuvet  sparkling wine from our sister winery Hudson Valley Vineyards  and then of course also  crisp and clean Farmhouse Chardonnay which is unoaked which actually just got 90 points from wine enthusiast  and  a Vidal oblong from our Heritage collection which is a collection of wines  made from grapes that have been grown in the Hudson Valley for over 85 years  then on the next page you'll find  our  seasonal tasting menu  where there are small bites using locally sourced ingredients  so maybe  I will give you a chance to just look over the menu while I go get you some Waters  and then I can come back  and we can start from there\n\n### Guest (4)\n\n*looking over the menu with interest* Wow, this all sounds fantastic! The history of the estate is really impressive - over 35 years of winemaking experience. And it's great to see the focus on sustainability and expressing the local terroir.\n\n*points to the giveaway page* Oh, a private dinner catered by the executive chef? That sounds amazing! We'll definitely enter the giveaway. You can never have too many chances to win free wine or a special dinner, right? *laughs*\n\nThe tasting flights look perfect for our first visit. I think it's a great idea to get a sense of the range of wines Milea produces. The Cabernet Franc and Farmhouse Chardonnay sound especially intriguing. 90 points from Wine Enthusiast is quite an accomplishment!\n\n*turns to wife* What do you think, Sarah? Should we do a tasting flight and maybe try some of the seasonal small bites too? I'm curious to see how they pair with the wines.\n\n*looks back at Russell* Thanks so much for the overview and recommendations. Waters would be great, and we'll take a few minutes to look everything over. We're looking forward to tasting some of your specialties!\n\n### Staff Member (5)\n\nokay I'm back with the waters  so have you decided what you would like to do\n\n### Guest (6)\n\n*smiles appreciatively as Russell returns with the water* Thank you so much, Russell. \n\n*turns to wife* So Sarah and I were talking, and we'd love to try the curated tasting flight. It seems like a perfect introduction to Milea's range of wines. I'm particularly excited to try the Cabernet Franc since you mentioned it's a flagship varietal for the winery.\n\n*looks back at the menu* And the seasonal small bites sound wonderful too. I noticed they use locally sourced ingredients, which is something we always appreciate. Do you have any recommendations for pairings with the tasting flight wines?\n\nAlso, we were curious to learn a bit more about the winemaking process here. The menu mentioned Milea focuses on minimal intervention and expressing the terroir. Could you tell us a bit more about that philosophy and how it impacts the wines?\n\nWe're so glad we decided to stop by Milea today. The setting is stunning and everything we've seen so far - from the history to the tasting options - has us really excited to experience the wines!\n\n### Staff Member (7)\n\nyeah for sure so I would definitely recommend  the brussel sprouts they're just a staple of the winery and  they're really some of my favorite things to eat  it's no exaggeration when I say I haven't had brussel sprouts quite like them anywhere else  and they pair really well I think with the Vidal Blanc I also would recommend the arancini they pair well across the entire flight  and then as far as our wine making philosophy  so we truly believe that great wine is made in the vineyard so we spent a lot of time in the vineyard doing High touch viticulture in order to really get the most out of the fruit and then  our winemaker really  just facilitates  the transition of fruit to wine  without adding a bunch of chemicals  and doing a lot of filtration  to  ameliorate the the wine  so it really is just a few expression of the site itself so when you're tasting Malaya wines you're tasting the sunlight the soil the location  would you like me to go ahead and order that food and get those lights out for you\n\n### Guest (8)\n\n*nods enthusiastically* The brussel sprouts sound amazing! I love when a winery has a signature dish that really stands out. And pairing them with the Vidal Blanc sounds perfect. We'll definitely have to try those.\n\n*turns to wife* What do you think about the arancini, Sarah? I know you love a good arancini, and if they pair well across the flight, that could be a great option too.\n\n*looks back at Russell* We really appreciate you sharing more about the winemaking philosophy. It's so important to us to understand where our wine comes from and how it's made. The focus on the vineyard and letting the fruit express itself really resonates with us. We've found that some of the best wines we've had are the ones that showcase the unique characteristics of the site.\n\n*smiles* Yes, please, if you could put in the order for the brussel sprouts and arancini, that would be wonderful. And we're definitely ready to start tasting the flight whenever you are!\n\n*leans forward eagerly* We can't wait to experience how the sunlight, soil, and location of Milea come through in each glass. This is exactly the kind of wine experience we were hoping to have today!\n\n### Staff Member (9)\n\nokay great so I'll put the order in for the food  and then I'll go get the first wines which we're going to start with  the Hudson Valley Vineyards Brew cuvet  I'll be right back\n\n### Guest (10)\n\n*grins with anticipation* Fantastic! We're so excited to get started. The Hudson Valley Vineyards Brut Cuvée sounds like a perfect way to kick things off. \n\n*turns to wife as Russell steps away* Can you believe this place, Sarah? The setting, the history, the philosophy...it's everything we look for in a winery. And I have a feeling the wines are going to be just as impressive.\n\n*looks around the tasting room appreciatively* I love how they've incorporated the natural beauty of the surrounding area into the design too. You can really tell they have a deep connection to the land here.\n\n*smiles as Russell returns* We're ready whenever you are, Russell! Can't wait to learn more about this Brut Cuvée and how it fits into the story of Milea and Hudson Valley Vineyards.\n\n*rubs hands together eagerly* Alright, let's do this! Our first taste of Milea awaits!\n\n### Staff Member (11)\n\nokay so we'll get started with the Hudson Valley Vineyards right Bank brute cuvet Hudson Valley Vineyards is our new winery that we're going to open next year that specializes in method champinois sparkling wines that is sparkling wines made in the champagne method  this wine is a blend of Chardonnay and Peter Noir it's been 18 months  on garage on the Lees in the bottle before it was discouraged  and then  we discouraged the wine and and now because of the time in the bottle you really get this elegant Aroma of brioche and toast  but with you still these very fresh flavors  of green apple  and sort of lemon and lime  it's really elegant expression you'll notice  the name is  the right bank and that's because we're doing two collections of wines at Hudson Valley Vineyards  right Bank are our East Coast wines starting with New York state but we would like to expand that collection to incorporate other east coast states and then the Left Bank are our West Coast wines again starting with Oregon and we would like to expand that to include  other cool areas  of the West Coast  such as the Sonoma Coast  and the Alexander Valley  so I'll give you  a few minutes to taste that wine  and then when I come back I should have your food order  and we can move on to the next line which will be our Farmhouse Chardonnay\n\n### Guest (12)\n\n*takes a sip of the Brut Cuvée, savoring the flavors* Mmm, this is delightful! The brioche and toast notes are so elegant, just like you said. But I love how they're balanced with those fresh, crisp flavors of green apple and citrus. It's a beautiful combination.\n\n*turns to wife* Sarah, you've got to try this. It's so different from the sparkling wines we usually have. You can really tell the care and time that went into crafting it.\n\n*looks back at Russell* It's fascinating to hear about the plans for Hudson Valley Vineyards and the two collections. The Right Bank and Left Bank concept is really clever - a great way to showcase the diversity of terroir on both coasts. \n\n*takes another sip, appreciating the wine* And 18 months on the lees! No wonder it has such depth and complexity. You can really taste the dedication to the traditional method.\n\n*smiles* We'll definitely be keeping an eye out for the opening of Hudson Valley Vineyards next year. It sounds like it's going to be a really special addition to the New York wine scene.\n\n*nods* Thanks so much for sharing the story behind this wine, Russell. We're already learning so much, and we're just on the first pour! Can't wait to see what's next.\n\n*settles back in chair, enjoying the Brut Cuvée* We'll savor this a bit more while we wait for the food and the Farmhouse Chardonnay. Cheers to a fantastic start!\n\n### Staff Member (13)\n\nokay so here we are with your arancini and your brussel sprouts I really hope you enjoy these I think you will  and now I have The Farmhouse Chardonnay  actually first how did you  you know finally  think about the  sparkling wine after you now had the full taste and really got a chance to to think about it what are your thoughts\n\n### Guest (14)\n\n*takes a final sip of the Brut Cuvée, considering the flavors* You know, Russell, I'm even more impressed with this wine after taking a moment to really savor it. The more I taste it, the more I appreciate the balance and finesse.\n\n*gestures with the glass* The brioche and toast notes are so well-integrated - they don't overpower the fruit, but they add this lovely depth and richness. And the green apple and citrus flavors are so vibrant and refreshing. It's like the best of both worlds in one glass.\n\n*turns to wife* What do you think, Sarah? I know you're usually more of a red wine drinker, but I feel like this sparkling wine could convert you!\n\n*looks back at Russell, smiling* Honestly, I'm just so impressed by the quality and character of this Brut Cuvée. It's clear that a lot of thought and care went into crafting it. And knowing the story and the philosophy behind it makes me appreciate it even more.\n\n*picks up an arancini, admiring it* And can I just say, these arancini look amazing! The perfect little bite to pair with the sparkling wine. *takes a bite* Oh wow, that's delicious. The flavors, the textures...you weren't kidding about the food here!\n\n*reaches for a brussel sprout* Alright, let's see if these live up to the hype too. *takes a bite, eyes widening* Okay, yep, I get it now. These are no ordinary brussel sprouts. The flavor is incredible!\n\n*grins at Russell* You've definitely won us over with this pairing. The Brut Cuvée and these small bites...it's a match made in heaven. \n\n*rubs hands together eagerly* But I'm ready to keep this tasting journey going! Bring on the Farmhouse Chardonnay!\n\n### Staff Member (15)\n\ngreat that's awesome  that you enjoyed the brewcuté  I'll hold a bottle aside so that we don't forget about it  for later in case you want to take some home  by the way  if for every three bottles that you take home one tasting fee will get  waived today  so next up we have our Farmhouse Chardonnay which is an unoaked Chardonnay so very fewer expression  very crisp very clean it's a blend of fruit from Long Island as well as nuts and Valley it's about a 60% Long Island Hudson Valley  ratio to Long Island fruit really brings a lot of salinity  because it's the fruits grown close to the ocean  and then the Hudson Valley Chardonnay brings a lot of depth to it but it's still very crisp clean linear  a lot of flavors of  things like  pear and Apple  and a nice fresh  acidity  Wine Enthusiast actually just scored this mine 90 points  so I'll let you go ahead and  taste that and then I'll come back with our  Farmhouse Cabernet Franc  actually before I go I forgot to ask where are you visiting us from today\n\n### Guest (16)\n\n*takes a sip of the Farmhouse Chardonnay, eyes lighting up* Wow, this Chardonnay is stunning! You're absolutely right about the crisp, clean profile. It's so refreshing and vibrant.\n\n*savors another sip* I love the interplay of the Long Island and Hudson Valley fruit. The salinity from the Long Island portion is so intriguing - it adds this wonderful coastal character. And the Hudson Valley component really does bring a lovely depth and complexity.\n\n*gestures with the glass* The pear and apple notes are so pure and focused. And that acidity! It's like a bright beam of sunshine in the glass. I can see why Wine Enthusiast scored it so highly.\n\n*turns to wife* Sarah, I think we might need to take some of this home with us. It's exactly the kind of Chardonnay we've been looking for - unoaked, expressive, and just so delicious.\n\n*nods at Russell* Thanks for holding a bottle of the Brut Cuvée aside for us. And that's great to know about the tasting fee being waived with a purchase of three bottles. We'll definitely keep that in mind as we taste through the lineup.\n\n*smiles* Oh, and to answer your question, we're visiting from New York City. We've been meaning to explore more of the Hudson Valley wine scene, and Milea has been on our list for a while now. We're so glad we finally made the trip!\n\n*takes another sip of the Chardonnay, savoring it* I have to say, between this Farmhouse Chardonnay and the Brut Cuvée, we're already so impressed with the quality and character of the wines here. Can't wait to try the Cabernet Franc next!\n\n*grins* Alright, Russell, lead the way! We're ready for the next step in our Milea journey.\n\n### Staff Member (17)\n\noh cool you're from the city so you're not that far away  so  you might be a really great addition to our wine club  in front of you  is some information about it  but what it is is essentially a subscription where  you can get four six or 12 bottles of Malaya wine every quarter  depending on what meets your needs  and then the club not only gets discounts on the wines  the Grand Prix and Triple Crown  tears get four free tastings every quarter  so you can bring in your friends  you also earn rewards points by being in the club for every dollar you spend and then those rewards can be redeemed for things like  merchandise and discounts or different experiences here at Malaya  and then there's also a really cool events that happened throughout the year where the club either gets in for free or deep discounts including the pickup parties were  probably most of our members come and actually physically pick up their wine and  enjoy special menus and entertainment that we bring in for those parties  so that's definitely something  to  consider so I'll let you look over the  wine club information while I go get that Cabernet Franc for you to taste\n\n### Guest (18)\n\n*picks up the wine club brochure, looking it over with interest* Wow, Russell, this wine club sounds fantastic! I love the idea of getting a curated selection of Milea wines delivered right to our door every quarter.\n\n*turns to wife* What do you think, Sarah? The flexibility of choosing between four, six, or twelve bottles per shipment is great. We could start with the smaller option and see how we like it.\n\n*looks back at the brochure* And the discounts and rewards points are a huge plus. We'd definitely take advantage of those free tastings to bring friends and share the Milea experience.\n\n*nods enthusiastically* The events sound amazing too! I love the idea of the pickup parties where we could come meet other members, enjoy some great food and entertainment, and of course, stock up on our favorite Milea wines.\n\n*looks up at Russell* We'll definitely give the club some serious consideration. It seems like a wonderful way to stay connected to the winery and keep exploring all the fantastic wines you're producing here.\n\n*takes another sip of the Chardonnay* And if the rest of the wines are anything like this Farmhouse Chardonnay and the Brut Cuvée, we'd be thrilled to have a steady supply coming our way!\n\n*smiles* Thanks for sharing the details on the club, Russell. We'll mull it over as we continue the tasting. But I have a feeling we might be signing up before we leave today!\n\n*settles back in chair* Alright, we're ready for that Cabernet Franc whenever you are. Can't wait to see Milea's take on another classic varietal!\n\n### Staff Member (19)\n\nall right now I'm back with the Cabernet Franc now that we've gone through the Chardonnay which you really seem to enjoy  which I'm thrilled about  so company Frank is  a staple of Malaya estate we actually started an organization with several other wineries around the state called cavity from forward  where we're really promoting coming Frank as New York's state red grape  expresses itself really well here in New York  it's definitely on the lighter side so when you think the name Cabernet you often think like deep dark Cabernet Sauvignon from Napa and that's not really what New York State company Frank is so Kevin Frank is more light more elegant and nuanced especially when it's grown at Northern latitudes like it is here in New York  so with our company Frank you'll find a lot of cherry and graphite really high toned beautiful  Aromas and flavors  definitely lighter on alcohol as well around 12%  so it's a really kind of responsible wine  also how did you  get on with the wine club information do you have any questions about the club\n\n### Guest (20)\n\n*takes a sip of the Cabernet Franc, savoring the flavors* Mmm, this is lovely! You're absolutely right about the elegance and nuance. It's a far cry from the bold, heavy Cabernet Sauvignons I'm used to, but in the best possible way.\n\n*swirls the glass, admiring the color* The cherry notes are so vibrant and pure. And that graphite minerality adds such an interesting dimension. It's like the wine has this wonderful tension between fruit and earth.\n\n*nods appreciatively* I love that it's a lighter style too. The lower alcohol makes it so easy to drink and enjoy. I could definitely see this being a go-to red for all sorts of occasions.\n\n*turns to wife* Sarah, I think we've found your new favorite red! The balance and finesse here is just stunning.\n\n*looks back at Russell* It's so interesting to hear about Cabernet Franc Forward and the push to promote Cab Franc as New York's signature red grape. Based on this wine, I can absolutely see why. It seems to thrive in the cooler climate here.\n\n*picks up the wine club brochure again* And to answer your question about the wine club, I think we're definitely leaning towards signing up! The only question we had was about the frequency of shipments. Is it possible to do fewer than four per year, or is quarterly the standard?\n\n*takes another sip of the Cab Franc* But really, with wines like this Cabernet Franc and the others we've tried so far, we'd be happy to have a regular supply coming our way. They're all so unique and expressive of the region.\n\n*smiles* I have a feeling this is just the beginning of a beautiful friendship with Milea and New York Cab Franc!\n\n### Staff Member (21)\n\nthat's great to hear that you like the wine it's one of my favorites  yeah so as for the  frequency of the shipments  it is  just a standard for shipments a year  but you can really decide  on what  tear fits your lifestyle the best so  jumper is the four bottle  tier where you get four bottles every 3 months and then the Grand Prix is six bottles every 3 months in Triple Crown is 12 bottles every 3 months  so based on your consumption habits  you can decide which is best for you  I would say  most people choose the Grand Prix  and but the Triple Crown  does offer more benefits especially like discounts on food  as well as deeper discounts on some of our culinary events and just other  other events  but I can see how 12 bottles every 3 months might be a lot of wine for some people  and then also  you can take your first shipment today  so for instance if you were to join Grand Prix  you could take six bottles today and that would count as your first shipment and then  you are required to take three more after that so you're required to take four shipments in total  but you would already have done  one  and then  you just have three more to do and then after that there's no early cancellation fee  yeah what do you think would you like to  sign up for the club today\n\n### Guest (22)\n\n*nods, considering the options* Thanks for clarifying the details on the frequency and tiers, Russell. It's helpful to know we have that flexibility to choose what works best for us.\n\n*turns to wife* What do you think, Sarah? The Grand Prix level with six bottles per quarter could be a good fit. It's enough to keep us well-stocked, but not too overwhelming. And the extra benefits at that tier sound great.\n\n*looks back at Russell* I like the idea of being able to take our first shipment home today too. It would be fantastic to share these wines with friends and family while they're still fresh in our minds from the tasting.\n\n*takes another sip of the Cab Franc, savoring it* And knowing we'd have three more shipments to look forward to after that is exciting. It's a great way to continue exploring Milea's range and see how the wines evolve over time.\n\n*nods decisively* Alright, I think we're ready to take the plunge! Let's sign up for the Grand Prix level. We'll do our first shipment today, and then we'll eagerly await the next three installments.\n\n*grins* I have a feeling this is going to be the start of a wonderful wine journey with Milea. We're so glad we discovered the winery and had a chance to taste through these fantastic wines with you, Russell.\n\n*raises glass* Here's to many more delicious bottles and memorable moments ahead! Cheers to Milea and our new membership in the wine club!\n\n### Staff Member (23)\n\nthat's great to hear that you like the wine it's one of my favorites  yeah so as for the  frequency of the shipments  it is  just a standard for shipments a year  but you can really decide  on what  tear fits your lifestyle the best so  jumper is the four bottle  tier where you get four bottles every 3 months and then the Grand Prix is six bottles every 3 months in Triple Crown is 12 bottles every 3 months  so based on your consumption habits  you can decide which is best for you  I would say  most people choose the Grand Prix  and but the Triple Crown  does offer more benefits especially like discounts on food  as well as deeper discounts on some of our culinary events and just other  other events  but I can see how 12 bottles every 3 months might be a lot of wine for some people  and then also  you can take your first shipment today  so for instance if you were to join Grand Prix  you could take six bottles today and that would count as your first shipment and then  you are required to take three more after that so you're required to take four shipments in total  but you would already have done  one  and then  you just have three more to do and then after that there's no early cancellation fee  yeah what do you think would you like to  sign up for the club today\n\n### Guest (24)\n\n*smiles broadly* Fantastic! We're thrilled to be joining the Milea wine club at the Grand Prix level. It feels like the perfect fit for us - enough wine to keep us well-stocked and exploring, but not too overwhelming.\n\n*turns to wife* Sarah, I'm so excited for us to take our first shipment home today. It'll be like extending this wonderful tasting experience into our own home. And we can start sharing Milea with our friends and family right away!\n\n*looks back at Russell* We really appreciate you taking the time to walk us through all the details and benefits. Knowing we have those extra perks like discounts on food and events is a huge plus. We'll definitely be taking advantage of those.\n\n*takes a final sip of the Cab Franc* And of course, getting to continue our journey with these incredible wines is the biggest draw. I can't wait to see what other gems we discover in future shipments.\n\n*nods decisively* Alright, let's make it official! Where do we sign up? We're ready to become proud members of the Milea wine club!\n\n*grins* You know, when we planned this trip to the Hudson Valley, we hoped we might find a winery that really spoke to us. But we never imagined we'd be leaving as club members with a whole case of wine in tow!\n\n*raises glass* Here's to serendipity, fantastic wines, and the start of a beautiful friendship with Milea. Cheers, Russell! And thank you for making our first visit so special.\n\n### Staff Member (25)\n\nokay great  so here's a form to fill out  with all your information for the wine club and then once you fill that out I'll get your credit card loaded up into your account and then you'll be all signed up and then from there  we'll just charge your credit card  automatically for every shipment and then anytime you come into Malaya you can just charge the card on file  and you don't even have to  you don't have your car to bring money with you  so while you fill that out I'm going to go ahead and get the last wine for your tasting  which will be the vincenza which is our Reserve Bordeaux red blend\n\n### Guest (26)\n\n*takes the form, looking it over* Perfect, thanks Russell. We'll get this filled out right away. It's great that everything will be automatically charged and we can just use the card on file when we visit. That'll make things so easy and seamless.\n\n*starts filling out the form, talking to wife* Okay Sarah, let's make sure we double check all the details here. We don't want any hiccups with our future shipments or visits!\n\n*looks up at Russell* And we're definitely excited to taste the Vincenza Reserve Bordeaux blend. A special wine to cap off a special tasting experience!\n\n*finishes filling out the form, handing it back to Russell* Alright, here you go! All signed up and ready to embark on our Milea wine journey. We can't thank you enough for introducing us to these incredible wines and the club.\n\n*grins* I have a feeling this is just the beginning of a long and fruitful relationship with Milea. We'll be the envy of all our wine-loving friends back in the city!\n\n*sits back, eagerly awaiting the Vincenza* Bring on the grand finale, Russell! Our palates are primed and ready. And then we'll be thrilled to take our first club shipment home and start spreading the Milea love.\n\n*raises imaginary glass* To Milea, to fantastic wines, and to our new status as proud Grand Prix members! Cheers!\n\n\n### Staff Member (30)\n\nawesome well thank you so much for joining the wine club I think you're going to really enjoy it  so next up we have our Vincenzo which is our Reserve photo red blend vincenza takes its name from Barry Malia's mother  and it's a Cabernet Franc forward  blend  about 50% cavity Frank followed by 20% Merlot and then the remainder is petite Verdo  which is fruit that we Source from  Long Island it's very hard to get it right  but  we let it hang for a very long time and when it does it brings in some nice structure to the wine so I think with this you're going to find  a lot of Plum as well as cherry  and some real nice depth to the wine  this wine actually just got 92 points and wine enthusiast  and so I'll let you go ahead and enjoy this wine and then when I come back we can discuss which ones you like to take home today in your first shipment  of six bottles or or more you can take more if you would like\n\n### Guest (31)\n\n*takes a sip of the Vincenza, eyes widening* Wow, Russell, this is truly something special. I can see why it's your reserve blend. The depth and complexity here are remarkable.\n\n*savors another sip* The Cabernet Franc really shines through with those beautiful plum and cherry notes. But the Merlot and Petit Verdot add such interesting layers. I love the structure and backbone that the Petit Verdot brings.\n\n*nods appreciatively* And 92 points from Wine Enthusiast? That's a testament to the quality and craftsmanship in this bottle. You can taste the care and attention that went into every step of the process.\n\n*turns to wife* Sarah, I think we might need to make some room in our wine fridge at home. This Vincenza is definitely coming back with us!\n\n*looks back at Russell, grinning* As for our first club shipment, I think we're going to have a hard time narrowing it down to just six bottles. Everything we've tasted today has been exceptional.\n\n*considers the options* Definitely a couple bottles of the Vincenza, of course. And I know we both loved the Farmhouse Chardonnay and the Cabernet Franc. The Brut Cuvée was a standout too.\n\n*turns to wife* What do you think, Sarah? Should we do two of each of those, plus the Vincenza? Or did any other wines call out to you?\n\n*looks at Russell, smiling* You know, we might just have to go above and beyond and do a full case for our first shipment. It's too hard to choose!\n\n*takes another sip of the Vincenza, savoring it* But what a wonderful problem to have. We're so grateful to have discovered Milea and all these incredible wines today.\n\n*raises glass* Here's to our first club shipment, and to many more happy hours spent enjoying Milea wines! Cheers, Russell! And thank you again for everything.\n\n### Staff Member (32)\n\nyeah full case is really not a bad idea  we get offer an additional 5% off that full case so  as opposed to your  normal 15% off that you'll get as a Grand Prix member will give you 20% off today  plus we'll load in 5,000 rewards points into your  account  to get you started  on those Rewards  how does that sound  so if you liked all four wines we could do three bottles of each wine for the case  would you like to do that\n\n### Guest (33)\n\n*eyes light up* An extra 5% off and 5,000 rewards points for a full case? Russell, you're speaking our language! That sounds like an incredible deal.\n\n*turns to wife, excited* Sarah, I think we'd be crazy not to take advantage of this offer. We loved all four wines, and getting a few bottles of each would give us such a great variety to enjoy at home.\n\n*nods enthusiastically* Three bottles each of the Vincenza, Farmhouse Chardonnay, Cabernet Franc, and Brut Cuvée would be perfect. That way, we can share them with friends, pair them with different meals, and really explore everything they have to offer.\n\n*grins at Russell* You've got a deal! Let's do the full case with that breakdown. We'll be the toast of the town with this collection!\n\n*takes wife's hand, smiling* I can already picture us opening a bottle of the Vincenza for a special dinner, or sipping the Farmhouse Chardonnay on the patio this summer.
